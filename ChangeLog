    commit adfcbb542e792e4e4a497695620c13d834533368

    Clarification on libraries needed.
            modified:   README.md
    Corrects typos in configure.ac (related to have_mmap)
            modified:   configure.ac
    Updates to today's date. Adds a section on
    downloading the library.

    commit 8b7d924f14db56385e87adbe44f76cbe9744b8c4

    In  dwarf_language_version_string() called
    dwarf_get_LNAME_name without casting Dwarf_Unsigned
    to unsigned int. Now with cast
    Windows VS warning fixed.

    commit 67cd09740080e55ecfa443182b96c34601acd362

    Added a note as we revise the heuristics on
    zstd/zlib to print the values resulting in error.
            modified:   doc/libdwarf.dox
    Improved error reports and created a new local function
    so even with longer error-check code calling it
    from two places (avoiding duplication)
    results in 20 lines less source code.

    commit 08ff7580f0afe0ea9b4ba61092cc545512e4360e

    On linux gdb and valgrind  and libc notice
    that printf of sequential byte pairs, where
    the byte-pairs accidentally overlap (!) due
    to a mistake in this source... is bogus.

    MacOS notices too, but it reports "Trace/BPT trap: 5"
    which is quite mysterious.
    This is a serious bug which has been in place
    since support for the DWARF5 .debug_names section
    was added.  It crashes the app reading the .debug_info
    section reliably.

    Of course simplereader is just an example, but
    still...needs to be correct

    It had been hidden from testing before due to an oversight in
    the  debugfissionb directory in regressiontests
    was coded. We now prevent corrupt
    DWARF with duplicated attributes in a PE file from
    showing an error and avoiding
    any meaingful test. Just for this case.
    So the tests are now fixed too.

    commit ad7d97b0434757cb3f43b77e0c322ae5005af9cf

    Added and documented
    dwarf_language_version_string()
    to the API so programs can interpret the
    version (as an integer) in detail should
    they wish to do so.

    The intent is the actual version is an integer
    and trivial to compare.  It's possible
    (though highly unlikely) that a real version
    might not be representable directly.
    DW_AT_language_version is a DWARF class CONSTANT,
    not a string.

    commit c4fbaaeda2feaafcc620d6bd5e927575eae8927b

    New options to prevent a libdwarf build from including
    references to mmap or sysconf or sys/mman.h:

    -DBUILD_MMAP=NO
            modified:   CMakeLists.txt

    --disable-mmap

    commit 43831b87e10e1e2503b625611ab66e00e256e4aa

    This completes the work for release 0.12.0
    (release date not yet scheduled) which enables
    use of mmap or malloc/read when libdwarf
    accesses object section data.

    A major compatibility break requiring
    code calling the library be recompiled with
    the new library.

    Systems without the functions/data to use mmap
    will compile normally, though the compatibility
    break is still applicable.

    Small changes may be required before release.

    Normal automatic update.

    commit bdcf44f89083d662a0efbae7f3e3efc4e68299d4

    Used the wrong destructor function in the modules
    structure. Result was crash.
    Repaired now.

    voted to make W_AT_language_name
    and DW_AT_language_version from DWARF6
    immutable values now.  So compilers wishing
    to add either or both to DWARF5
    compiler output are officially allowed to use
    these now.
